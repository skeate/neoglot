  <h2>Help - Word Generator</h2>

  <p>
    The word generator is fairly powerful, but with that comes complexity.
    Here I'll describe how to use it to construct Japanese-like words, which
    will cover most of the features (all but one, which I'll describe at the
    end). In case you're unfamiliar, Japanese words are composed, essentially,
    of [C]V syllables (though n can stand on its own). Let's start there.
  </p>
  <h4>Selectors and Output</h4>
  <p>
    If you look at a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana">Hiragana</a>
    chart, you'll find it has 5 vowels (a, i, u, e, o) and 14 consonants (k, s, t,
    n, h, m, y, r, w, g, z, d, b, p). Let's make some <strong>Selector</strong>
    definitions.
    <code>Vowel=aiueo
      Consonant=kstnhmyrwgzdbp
    </code>
    Some terminology: each line is a "rule". The left side of the = declares a
    name, and the right side are the choices to select from. The name doesn't
    really matter; if you prefer brevity, you could name them V and C, for example.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, this does not generate any output. If you try this, you'll get a
    message saying "No output rule." Let's add one.
    <code>Vowel=aiueo
      Consonant=kstnhmyrwgzdbp
      >ConsonantVowel
    </code>
    Now if you click Generate, you'll get a bunch of two-letter words, each
    a consonant followed by a vowel. We can now see what the Selectors are
    doing: if you refer to one by name, the name will be replaced with one
    of the characters at random.
  </p>
  <h4>Mergers and Repetition</h4>
  <p>
    But our words should be more than two letters. How do we achieve this?
    First, let's define a Syllable.
    <code>Vowel=aiueo
      Consonant=kstnhmyrwgzdbp
      Syllable:ConsonantVowel
      >Syllable
    </code>
    The output is the same as before. Why did we do this? Well, two reasons.
    1. Introduce <strong>Mergers</strong>. These have names, like the
    Selectors, but rather than picking one character at random, it merges
    them all together. In fact, the Output is just a special case, unnamed
    Merger. 2. By combining them into a named rule, we can repeat the rule
    in the output.
    <code>Vowel=aiueo
      Consonant=kstnhmyrwgzdbp
      Syllable:ConsonantVowel
      >Syllable{100,95,90,70,50,30,20,...}
    </code>
    The list of numbers in the {braces} represent repetition probabilities.
    In this case, syllable has a 100% chance of appearing once, then a 95%
    chance of appearing again, then 90%, 70%, and so on. The ... at the end
    means "repeat the last probability until failure". If the generator
    gets to the 8th syllable, it will add more at a 20% chance each time.
    Strictly speaking, this could repeat forever, but the chances of it are
    very slim.
  </p>
  <h4>Name Resolution</h4>
  <p>
    Okay, so we have a generator that will produce CV[CV]*, but Japanese
    can have syllables with a "y" sound, like "kya". Let's add that. It
    only applies to the vowels a, u, and o, though. It also only works
    with some consonants&emdash;"y", "w", and "d" are left out.
    <code>Vowel=aiueo
      Consonant=kstnhmyrwgzdbp
      Syllable:ConsonantVowel

      PVowel=auo
      PConsonant=kstnhmrgzbp
      PSyllable:PConsonantyPVowel

      >Syllable{100,95,90,70,50,30,20,...}
    </code>
    A few things are noteworthy here. (1) They are named P___ because the
    adding of the y is known as palatalization. (2) There is not a name
    conflict, even though the name "PVowel" contains another name inside it;
    this is because name detection is done with the longest names first.
    Typically this shouldn't be a problem, but you should be careful with
    naming to avoid any issues. (3) There's a y in the PSyllable Merger.
    It's not a name of any other rules, so it's interpreted as the character.
    (4) We haven't added it to the output.
  </p>
  <h4>Adjusting Probabilities</h4>
  <p>
    Before we add palatalized syllables to the output, let's also consider
    that we are missing one syllable case&emdash;a vowel by itself. Let's
    solve both of these problems at the same time.
    <code>Vowel=aiueo
      Consonant=kstnhmyrwgzdbp
      Syllable:ConsonantVowel

      PVowel=auo
      PConsonant=kstnhmrgzbp
      PSyllable:PConsonantyPVowel

      Out=6Syllable4Vowel1PSyllable1
      >Out{100,95,90,70,50,30,20,...}
    </code>
    You can see we've declared a new Selector named Out and are repeating
    that for the output, rather than Syllable directly. But what are these
    numbers? By default, all choices in a Selector are equally likely to
    be chosen. By adding these numbers, we've tweaked the probability.
  </p>
  <p>
    The number immediately after the = is the base probability. If it's
    missing, it's assumed to be 100. The numbers after each choice are
    the probabilities for that choice. In this case, Syllable has a 4/6
    chance, and Vowel and PSyllable each have a 1/6 chance. If any
    choices were missing probabilities, they'd divide any remaining
    probability evenly. For example, consider V=a15e15iou. Here we
    have declared no base probability, so it defaults to 100. a and e
    each have 15% chance of being selected. The other three choices
    have no probability declared, so the split the remainder, 70%.
    Thus, i, o, and u each have a 70%/3 = ~23.3% chance of being
    selected.
  </p>
  <h4>Substitutions</h4>
  <p>
    With Japanese, some syllables are actually pronounced and romanized
    contrary to what might make sense. For example, with T as the initial
    consonant, you have ta, te, and to, but chi instead of ti and tsu
    instead of tu. These irregularities can be handled with Substitutions.
    <code>Vowel=aiueo
      Consonant=kstnhmyrwgzdbp
      Syllable:ConsonantVowel

      PVowel=auo
      PConsonant=kstnhmrgzbp
      PSyllable:PConsonantyPVowel

      Out=6Syllable4Vowel1PSyllable1
      >Out{100,95,90,70,50,30,20,...}
      si~shi
      hu~fu
      sy~sh
      ty~ch
      ti~chi
      tu~tsu
      yi~wi
      ye~we
      di~ji
      du~zu
      zi~ji
      oo~ô
      ou~ô
      uu~û
    </code>
    These rules replace text directly in the output. They'll be run in
    the order they're declared, so be careful. In this case, for example,
    note that ty~ch is declared after hu~fu; if they were swapped, it
    could generate "tyu", get substituted with "chu", then substituted
    again with "cfu".
  </p>
  <h4>Other Things</h4>
  <p>
    That's it for the Japanese-style generator. There are a few things I
    did not touch on in the process. (1) Elements in Mergers can also
    have probabilities. The numbers in braces are just a special case of
    this. You could have an optionally included element with, e.g., N:n50.
    This would produce n half the time, and an empty string the rest.
    (2) There is another kind of rule, the Mimic. The idea behind it is
    to simulate the style of a list of words; essentially it works by
    analyzing what letters tend to follow a given letter, and then
    weighted-randomly generating words based on that. The syntax is
    <code>Mime&lt;[this is a list of words]</code>
    If you then added &gt;Mime, you'd get output like "a", "ords", "isthis",
    and "wof". It's not perfect, but it could be a useful tool.
